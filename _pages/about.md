<!--- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

<strong> Quantitive Researcher | Data Scientist | Tech Nerd </strong>



I am a London-based quantitive researcher with 6+ years of experience working in the research sector. I use mathematical modelling, data analysis & visualisation, and Monte Carlo simulation methods to tackle complex interdisciplinary problems.
In 2019, I received my PhD in Applied Mathematics from King’s College London. I spent 4 years working in the <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/research/disordered-systems">Disordered Systems group</a>, where I developed models of gene regulatory networks to understand cellular identity and cell state transitions.


After my PhD, I worked in collaboration with King’s College London and <a href="https://clicksymptoms.co.uk/">ClickSymptoms</a> developing an algorithm which diagnoses musculoskeletal conditions from patient symptoms. The algorithm is based on Bayesian inference and bipartite network theory. I developed and documented the algorithm as a Python package.

I am currently working as a Postdoc at the <a href="https://lims.ac.uk/">London Institute for Mathematical Sciences</a>, where I focus on mathematical models for cell programming & reprogramming.
