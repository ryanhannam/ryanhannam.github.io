<!--- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I am a London-based quantitive researcher with 6+ years of experience working in the research sector. I use mathematical modelling, data analysis & visualization, and Monte Carlo simulation methods to tackle complex interdisciplinary problems.

In 2019, I received my PhD in Applied Mathematics from Kingâ€™s College London. I spent 4 years working in the Disordered Systems group, where I developed models of gene regulatory networks to understand cellular identity and cell state transitions.

After my PhD, I worked in collaboration with King's College London and [ClickSymptoms](https://clicksymptoms.co.uk/), to develop an algorithm to diagnose musculoskeletal conditions from patient symptoms, using Bayesian inference and bipartite network theory.

I am currently working as a Postdoc at the [London Institute for Mathematical Sciences](https://lims.ac.uk/), where I focus on mathematical models for cell programming & reprogramming.
